    <string name="story_1">Loud knocking to the door woke you up in the morning. On the threshold you saw the confidant of the king. He kindly invited you to the Royal Palace, saying that the matter is urgent. The king himself is waiting for you.\n Approaching the Royal palace, you wonder why the king needs to talk to a simple blacksmith… </string>
    <string name="story_2">My loyal subject, for the last time, my health began to weaken, and my sworn enemy King Bruenor from the southern lands is very powerful and aggressive. The Kingdom is in danger. If I die and the southerners come upon us, many innocent citizens of my Kingdom will perish</string>
    <string name="story_3">Beyond the dry lands, on the East, the dark wizard lives. He possesses secret and powerful spell. If you come back with this spell, the Kingdom can be saved. You are known as one of the best blacksmiths of the Kingdom, your hand is strong and your will is like a steel. I ask you to do this favour for me</string>
    <string name="story_4">The king has blessed you and wished you not to surrender in the face of difficulties. You have left the Palace and are ready to start the journey</string>
    <string name="story_5">You\'ve come to the Eastern gates of the city. At the gates you met a guard who is interested in where you are going</string>
    <string name="story_6">You told the guard about your plans to go beyond the Arden forest. He is very concerned about your story, and wishes you the help of the Almighty God</string>
    <string name="story_7">No one has entered the Arden forest for many years. Rumor has it that at night there is a huge howl from the wolves, and at dawn you can meet the dead mermaids floating in the forest mist. Behind the Arden forest there are dry lands where you will give all your gold for a drop of water</string>
    <string name="story_8">You came out to the East to the big valley. You enjoy fine weather, a light wind breezing blowing and birds sing. You have two days journey to the Arden forest through the valley</string>
    <string name="story_9">The Great valley is beautiful, but you have long way to go</string>
    <string name="story_10">You have passed the green valley and reached the edge of the Arden forest. There are many bad rumors about this forest, it\'s time to check which of them are true.</string>
    <string name="story_11">You passed some distance in the woods before dark. Strange rustling is heard around, in the distance you hear lingering howl of wolves. You need to sleep, but how to do it in such a disturbing environment?</string>
    <string name="story_12">You need to fall asleep in order to have the strength to continue the trip tomorrow</string>
    <string name="story_13">In the dream you see a dark forest. The moon shines brightly through the trees. In the haze dark silhouette with a scythe is approaching you. The silhouette swings his scythe and screams \"I need your sooouul\"</string>

    <string name="option_1">Enter the king\'s palace</string>
    <string name="option_2_1">My Lord, I\'m a simple blacksmith. How can I help you?</string>

    <string name="option_2_3">Nod reverently and listen</string>
    <string name="option_3_1">My King, for you I\'ll go to the edge of the world</string>
    <string name="option_3_2">My Lord, I know what the Eastern lands are dangerous. But I\'ll try to get back with the spell</string>
    <string name="option_4">Start the journey</string>
    <string name="option_5_1">Tell that you have urgent order from the King, and go through the gates</string>
    <string name="option_5_2">Talk to the guard</string>
    <string name="option_6_1">Thank him and traverse the gates</string>
    <string name="option_6_2">What\'s so special about Arden forest?</string>
    <string name="option_7_1">Thank him and go through the gates</string>
